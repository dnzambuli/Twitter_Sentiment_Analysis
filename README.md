### Project Scope

- Create and test a model for sentiment analysis using
* vader - a basic tokenizer and sentiment analysis tool from `python NLTK`
* Roberta - a sentiment analysis pretrained tool offered by `hugging face`

- After trying to assess model accuracy using `old newspaper`  data from `kaggle` to see if the model can detect sentiments in  other languages

### Key Features
1. Exploritory Data Analysis
2. Sample Analysis using Vader Model
3. Using vader on Twitter Covid-19 data
4. Sample Analysis using Roberta Model
5. Using Roberta on Twitter Covid-19 data
6. Comparing Vader and Roberta

### Outline of AI Concepts Adopted in the Projects
1. Natural Language Processing to extract sentiments
2. Using pretrained models for tokenizing sentiments, pos-tagging, feature extracting and classiffying text into `positive` , `neutral` , or `negative`
3. Classification to group the tweets based on their positivity
